# Video Annotation Sample Project

This is a sample project showing how I annotated videos using the [VGG Image Annotator (VIA)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) tool.

## üîç Overview

The annotations were created for video footage of industrial tasks. The goal was to:

- Label each action or tool used frame-by-frame
- Use temporal segmentation to show exactly when each tool or task appears
- Export clean JSON data for machine learning or review
